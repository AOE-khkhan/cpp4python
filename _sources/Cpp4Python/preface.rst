Preface
=======

Welcome to *C++ for Python Programmers*. This short ebook is an ongoing
project to help Computer Science students who have had one or two
semesters of Python to learn the C++ programming language. If you are not
a part of that audience, you may still find this a useful way to learn
about C++. This book is written using the "build on what you know"
philosophy. In order to help you learn C++, we will start with a Python
example and then implement the example in C++. Along the way we will
examine the strengths, weaknesses and differences between these two
languages.

This book does not attempt to replace the many good C++ reference books
that are available, in fact at Berea College we use this book in our
Data Structures course along with other C++ resources.
Please feel free to use this book for yourself, or if it fits a class you are
teaching, you are welcome to use this as a resource for your own class.

We have published this article using a Creative Commons license to
encourage you to use it, change it, and modify it for your own purposes.
We would appreciate knowing what you think if you do use this book, and we
would love to see any modifications or additions you make.
