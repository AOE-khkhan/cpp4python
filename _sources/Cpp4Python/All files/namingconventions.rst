Naming Conventions
==================

{sec:naming\_conventions}

C++ has some very handy naming conventions. It is worth noting that these conventions may not be required and the codes would still be functional but the main goal for the conventions is to standardize the coding in order for other programmers to understand it better.

- Meaningless abbreviations should always be avoided. They can confuse other programmers as to what the piece of code might actually perform.

- Methods should always start with a lower case letter, and use underscore & hyphens to add detail to the names.
for example: next_value(), my_date_of_birth(), eat_food() and covert-to-binary() etc.

- Method names should not start with numbers or underscores.

- Single variable names are fine for temporary, local purposes such as

       "for (int i = 0; i < number_s; i++)"
   However for longer chunks of codes, it is advisable that more defined and meaningful variable names may be used.

- It is always helpful to add comments to different parts of the code.
