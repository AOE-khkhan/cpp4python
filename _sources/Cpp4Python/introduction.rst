Introduction
============

This book assumes that you are already familiar with the
`Python <http://www.python.org>`_ programming language. We will use
Python as a starting point for our journey into C++. We will begin by
looking at a very simple C++ program, just to see what the language
looks like and how we get a program to run. Next, we will look at the
main constructs that are common to most programming languages:

    -  Data Types

    -  Loops

    -  Reading user input

    -  Conditionals

Once we have the basics of C++ behind us we will move on to look at the
features of C++ that are both unique and powerful.

    -  Classes

    -  Interfaces

    -  Collections

    -  Generic Programming

Please note that this book is a work in progress. We will continue to
update and post new versions.
