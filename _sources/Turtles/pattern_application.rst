Practical Application - Tessellation
====================================

Art takes a variety of forms, ranging from abstract to realistic,
and consisting of an impossibly wide variety of materials.
Ancient Sumerians would dye and dry small pieces of clay to create mosaics.
These mosaics were often composed of shapes and patterns that would overlap
without any gaps in between them. This art form is known today as tessellation,
which can be observed in any modern building that is composed of bricks,
or any floor covered in ceramic tiles. Mosaics are defined by their interlocking shapes,
however, what these shapes are made of‒ or, the medium‒ varies depending on the artist.

The common mediums for this art form have changed over time,
ranging from pieces of clay to pieces of wood. More recently,
digital mediums have been used as an effective alternative to physical materials.
Turtles are one of many such digital mediums, and are often used to
create images rich in repetitive features. Your task will be to create
a mosaic-like tessellating image using turtles.

Consider the following example.

You must create a similar image with the following criteria:
There must be more than four edges per shape
There must be no more than two colors for the shapes in the image.

Introduction -
    Description of mosaics - trace back to sumerians, clay tiles for decorative features
        Eqyptians, persians, romans, chinese, etc. with different variations
    Segway into tesselation under historical context
        "when a geometric shape is repeated over and over again resulting in a tile with no gaps"
    Introduce example code for chess board pattern?
    Talk about limitations (more than 4 edges per shape, maximum of two fill colors)
    Prompt for activecode
        basic skeleton for CTurtle usage to start with?


Tessellating pattern 
    Historical context - mosaics
    More than four edges per shape
    Two colors only for shapes
    Encourage experimentation        
    Example pattern   
    Simple example, chess grid?
