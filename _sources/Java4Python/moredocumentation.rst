C++ Documentation Online
=========================

All C++ class libraries are documented and available online. Here is
a good resource for you to use:

-  `DevDocs <http://devdocs.io/cpp/>`_ The devdocs online website
   provides a nice searchable interface. Search for a topic and you
   will get the documentation you are looking for.
-  `CplusPlus <http://www.cplusplus.com/>`_ contains the same information, but in a simplified
   browsing format. All the information is broken down into different categories to make what you're looking
   for easier to find.

In general the Devdocs page contains information about:

-  A library and some examples about utilities like memory management and error handling.

-  A library and some examples about Strings.

-  A library and some examples about Containers.

-  A library and some examples about Input/Output.

-  A library and some examples about Classes.
