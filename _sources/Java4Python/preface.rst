Preface
=======

Welcome to *C++ for Python Programmers*. This short ebook is an ongoing
project to help Computer Science students who have had one or two
semesters of Python learn the C++ programming language. If you are not
a part of that audience you may still find this a useful way to learn
about C++. This book is written using the build on what you know
philosophy. In order to help you learn C++ we will start with a Python
example and then implement the example in C++. Along the way we will
examine the strengths, weaknesses and differences between those two
languages.

This book does not attempt to replace the many good C++ reference books
that are available, in fact at Berea College we use this in our Data Structures course 
along with other C++ resources. Please feel free to use this book for
yourself, or if it fits a class you are teaching you are welcome to use
this as a resource for your own class.
