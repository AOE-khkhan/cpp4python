Colophon
========

The Java version of this book was started in 2006 using Pythonâ€™s restructured text.
In 2007 it was switched to markdown using the variant of markdown used by
the `pandoc <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/>`_. program because
Pandoc does an excellent job of converting markdown to html, latex, pdf, and other formats.

Runestone Plug
--------------

We would also like to use this space as a plug for
`Runestone books <http://interactivepython.org/>`_
which are not only free and open source but also allow students
to run their code in browser and instructors to
monitor their students' work.
