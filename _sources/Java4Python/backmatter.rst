Colophon
========

The Java versionn of this book was started in 2006 using Pythonâ€™s restructured text.
In 2007 it was switched to markdown using the variant of markdown used by
the `pandoc <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/>`_ program because 
Pandoc does an excellent job of converting markdown to html, latex, pdf,
and other formats. 

Shameless Plug
--------------

We would also like to use this space as a shameless plug for 
[Runestone books](http://interactivepython.org/) 
which are not only free and open source but allow students 
to run their code in browser, and allow insftructors to 
monitor their students' work.
