For Loops
=========

Even though the ``while`` type of construct is very useful in a wide variety of
situations, another iterative structure, the ``for`` statement, can be
used to iterate across a range of values easily. However, you must first find
the length of your container. For vectors, you can simply call the ``.length()`` function.
For arrays, the number of elements can be found by getting the size in memory of the array
by using the ``sizeof()`` function, and then dividing it by the size of the first element of
the array using the same ``sizeof()`` function. Because all elements in C++ arrays are
the same type, they take the same amount of space and that can be used to find the number
of elements the Array contains!

.. activecode:: arrayIteration1
   :language: cpp
   :sourcefile: ArrayIteration.cpp

   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;

   int main() {
       int nums[] = {1,3,6,2,5};
       int numsSize = sizeof(nums)/sizeof(nums[0]); // Get size of the nums array

       for (int index=0; index<numsSize; index++) {
           cout << nums[index] << endl;
       }


      // Simpler Implementation that may only work in
      // Newer versions of C++

      // for (int item:nums) {
      //     cout << item << endl;
      // }

  	return 0;
   }


An optional secondary version of the ``for`` loop has been commented out of the above code.
You can try running this in your version of C++ to see if it works, but in some older versions of C++,
such as C++98, it does not.

The above loop assigns the variable ``index`` to be each successive value from 0 to numsSize.
 Then, the value at that index in the array is printed to the console.

A common use of the ``for`` statement is to implement definite iteration
over a range of values. The code

.. activecode:: rangeForLoop1
   :language: cpp

   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;

    int main() {
        for (int i=0; i<5; i++) {
            cout<<i*i<<endl;
        }

        return 0;
    }

will use ``cout`` five times.  The value of the variable ``i`` will
start at 0 and go through the full sequence of values 0,1,2,3,4.  This
value is then squared and printed.

The other very useful version of this iteration structure is used to
process each character of a string. The following code fragment iterates
over a list of strings and for each string processes each character by
appending it to a list. The result is a list of all the letters in all
of the words.

.. activecode:: intro_81
   :language: cpp



   #include <iostream>
   #include <vector>
   #include <string>
   using namespace std;

    int main() {
    	vector<string> wordList = {"cat", "dog", "rabbit"};
    	string letterlist;

    	for (size_t i = 0; i < wordList.size(); i++) {
    		for (size_t j = 0; j < wordList[i].size(); j++) {
                        letterlist.push_back(wordList[i][j]);
    		}
    	}

    	cout << letterlist << endl;
    }
