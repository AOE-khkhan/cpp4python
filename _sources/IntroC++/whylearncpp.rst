Why Learn another programming Language?
=======================================

Python is a nice language for beginning programming for several reasons.
First, the syntax is both sparse and clear. Second, the underlying model of
how objects and variables work is very consistent. Third, you can write
powerful and interesting programs without a lot of work. However, Python
is representative of one kind of language, called a dynamic language.
One might think of Python as being fairly informal. Other
languages, like C, C++, and Java are more formal.

These other languages have some advantages of their own. First, is speed: For
very large programs C and C++ are likely to give you the best
performance. Second is their maintainability. A lot of what makes Python
easy to use is that you must remember certain things. For example if you
set variable ``x`` to reference a turtle, and forget later that ``x`` is
a turtle but try to invoke a string method on it, you will get an error.
C++ protects you by forcing you to be upfront and formal about
the kind of object each variable is going to refer to.

In one sense Python is representative of a whole class of languages,
sometimes referred to as “scripting languages.” Other languages in the
same category as Python are Ruby and Perl. C++ is representative of
what one might call industrial strength languages. Industrial strength
languages are good for projects with several or many people working on the
project where being formal and careful about what you do may impact lots
of other people. Languages in this category include C, C#, C++, Ada, and Java.

Programming languages are likely to regularly change as time passes.
As the field of computer science advances there are likely to be new programming
languages that you will need to learn. It is important to learn multiple programming
languages early so that you know what to expect. There are certain features
that most programming languages have in common such as variables, loops,
conditionals, and functions. And there are other features that are unique. If
you know what is common in most languages that is a good place to start.

Why Learn C++? Why not Java or Javascript?
---------------------------------

    - C++ influenced many programming languages such as C#, Java and other newer versions of C.

    - C++ was the first widely used object-oriented programming (OOP) language,
      supporting the four primary features of OOP:
      abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

    - C++ is industrial strength used for large systems by large groups of people.

    - C++ is particularly good at interacting directly with computer hardware.

C++ is an enormous language and is very powerful. We will be using C++ throughout
the semester to write interesting code.
